# Past, Present and Future - Rambling Thoughts
### July 17th, 2016

Over the last few weeks I had been looking at my skills as a developer in terms of how much I have left to learn. This "To Do" list seemed to be never ending, and sometimes it felt like I would not be able to finish it. That put me in a situation where I felt like I haven't progressed much since my early days. However, as I began to work on the latest version of my website, I got to revisit a lot of my old code, and in [one case](https://bagelsbakery.com/projects/imgular) work on it again. It was this adventure that caused me to think about the past, present and future as a single entity that has, and will continue to, define my goals as a developer.

As I looked through my old code, I was able to see how much I have grown as a developer, even though I never really felt like it due to the "To Do" list I mentioned above. Due to that realization, I was able to create a new goal for myself as I move forward which is:
- consistently improve over time, and regularly look back on the things that I have done as a means to confirm it.

That brings me to the present, in which I took a look at my current daily tasks at work and analyzed how they play a role in my progression. At first, it seemed like a bad thing that I was working on the same code base, and using the same toolset, day in and day out. However, I now believe that having that consistency is what motivated me to drastically improve both the development process and the [product](https://one.uf.edu) over time. So, now I have another goal:
- keep creating new challenges and problems to solve to keep the mundane interesting.

Looking towards the future causes everything to come full circle as I think about the "To Do" list. The whole reason I created such a thing to begin with was to fulfill the goals I outlined above, without ever realizing it. Originally, my mind was locked in on completing the list as a means to "keep up with the trends", but I now see it as:
- a creation of new challenges and problems to solve
- a way to consistently improve over time.

So, with my "To Do" list in hand, a better understanding of what the list represents, and taking the time to stop and regularly look back while keeping the mundane interesting, I have a more positive outlook on my skills as a developer.
