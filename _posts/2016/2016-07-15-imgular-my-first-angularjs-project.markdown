# Imgular - My First AngularJS Project
### July 15th, 2016

Before I began to heavily use AngularJS at work, I wanted to create a small project in my spare time to tinker with the framework, and get a laugh or two out of it. Imgular was the result of this idea, and it provided both horrors and chuckles to me as it generated thumbnails of random images from <a href="https://imgur.com" target="_blank"_>imgur</a>.

I have yet to rework the code of this classic masterpiece, and I'm not sure when I ever will, so for now I use the codebase as a 'what not to do' with AngularJS (or merely coding in general). You can check it out on <a href="https://github.com/MatthewJohnson3154/imgular" target="_blank"_>GitHub</a>. If the code isn't enough to scare you away, I went ahead and revived it for use, just note that it may return NSFW results, so use with care. Cheers, and happy image hunting...
